# Hotel_Management_System_
We built this web-based POS (Point of Sales for Hotel Management System) application to simplify and streamline day-to-day operations in a hotel setting. Our goal is to integrate core functionalities such as managing customers, employees, restaurant/bar services, financial records, and supplier data into one centralized platform. The system allows admins to handle customer and employee registrations, update records, and manage different user roles (like receptionist, chef, cashier, etc.). It also supports placing restaurant and bar orders, connecting them with supplier and inventory modules to ensure efficient stock usage and control. To support financial transparency, the platform records income and expenses, generates financial summaries, and supports basic event management like scheduling hotel events (meetings, parties, etc.). All modules are interlinked to provide an integrated experience to users and minimize manual errors. This project was developed using modern web technologies like React.js for the frontend, Node.js & Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. It follows Agile methodology with backlog planning, sprints, and tracking tools like Trello. The result is a scalable, modular, and easy-to-use POS system tailored for hotel environments.
